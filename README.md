## Pong ##

This project was made using JavaFX.  This version of Pong is slightly different from the usual version.  If your paddle is going fast enough when you hit the ball, it will cause the ball to spin until the other paddle hits it back.  When the ball is spinning it bounces differently and must be tracked differently than when it's not.

You can play against another human player or against an AI player with two difficulty modes to choose from (EASY & HARD).

First to 7 points wins.

### Controls ###

Left Paddle:
<br>
W -> up
<br>
S -> down

Right Paddle (when playing against another human):
<br>
O -> up 
<br> 
L -> down

### To Play ###

1. Download the .zip file
2. Extract
3. Open the project in Intellij IDE
4. Run it
5. Play Pong

Eventually I will turn this into an executable for easier access.
